ANSWERS:
1. for 1.7 we chose to use the first option.
    pros:
    - simplicity: this option is simpler since we don't need to add public methods to th BrickerGameManager.
    - separation: we kept the collision strategy outside of the game managment.
    - Flexible: the code this way can be reusable with all object types and all game layers.
    cons:
    - encapsulation issue: Exposing too much detail about game objects to the CollisionStrategy classes,
      which can lead to unintended effects.
2.
API CHANGES:
Brick -
- brickLayer - it's important to implement in the constructor the Layer that brick going to be in to send it to
 the collision strategy in case we would like to delete it.
